The Open Science Company Manifesto
==================================

This manifesto aims at defining fundamental statements every Company running
with the Open Science initiative in mind must respect and promote.

## Open Science pillars are [the Company] culture

Unless [the Company] has good reasons for not respecting them (such as National
Security), every principle of the Open Science initiative should be considered
as an organization's *credo*.

Each time [the Company] produces source code that could help other scientists in
their everyday work (software, data analysis, web servers, etc.), the code
should be open and stored in a public forge that eases community contributions
and explicitly states on its licensing and credits.

If relevant for the scientific community, scientific data collected by [the
Company] should be stored in a public repository that explicitly states on its
licensing and credits. [The Company] should carefully pay attention to the
repository terms & conditions before submitting data to this repository.
Institutional repositories (such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)) must be the
primary choice, but, third-party repositories can also be considered if the
service maintainer (company or institution) explicitly states on the future of
stored data when that maintainer status evolves (fusion, acquisition,
liquidation).

When the time to publish research results has come, [the Company] submits its
manuscript to Open Access journals with an Open Peer Review process.

## Users are not the product

If [the Company] provides a service such as a platform available through the
World Wide Web (SaaS), [the Company] commits itself to never exploit users' data
or behaviors. By "exploit" we mean sending users' data (even anonymized) to a
third-party in order to make profit. Users should be considered as contributors
to the common goods, not as products.

## Open & Privacy must cohabit

Being open does not mean sharing everything with no respect for privacy. Hence,
[the Company] must provide a way for its customers to keep their data private
until they decide to free their content. [The company] must incentive, not force
to share though.

## Investors must embrace this Manifesto

If [the Company] is raising funds, incoming investors must accept all rules
stated in this Manifesto without any modification. To prevent further corruption
of [the Company] values, [the Company] statuses deposited to the administration of
the country of affiliation should refer to this Manifesto.
