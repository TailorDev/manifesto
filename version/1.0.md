The Open Science Company Manifesto
==================================

This manifesto aims at defining fundamental statements that every company
running with the Open Science Initiative in mind must respect and promote.

## Open Science pillars are [the company] culture

Every principle of the Open Science Initiative must be considered as an
organization's *credo* unless [the company] has good reason not respect
them (such as national security).

Each time [the company] produces source code that helps other scientists in
their everyday work (software, data analysis, web servers, etc.), the code
must be open and stored in a public forge to ease community contributions.
Furthermore, this must be explicitly stated within the codes licensing and
credits.

In addition, any scientific data collected by [the company] that is relevant
to the scientific community must also be stored in a public repository.
[The company] must explicitly state their terms & conditions within the
codes licensing and must always adhere to these conditions before submitting
data to the repository. Institutional repositories (such as
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)) must be the primary choice, but,
third-party repositories may also be considered if the service maintainer
(company or institution) explicitly states the future of the stored data when
the maintainer status evolves (fusion, acquisition, liquidation).

When the time to publish research results has come, [the company] submits its
manuscript to open access journals with an open peer review process.

## Users are not the product

[The company] must respect the user's right to privacy. [The company] must not
sell or give away data about user's use patterns, locations, or other metadata
without explicit, informed consent from the user.

[The company] must respect the user's right to keep their scientific data
private. [The company] will never sell or give away a user's unpublished
scientific data. [The company] will not publish any analysis that
includes data which are not publically available at the time of publishing.

[The company] should treat users as contributors to the common goods, not
as products. Users have a right to know where their data is being stored
and how it is being used.

## Open & Privacy must cohabit

Being open does not mean sharing everything with no respect for privacy. Hence,
[the company] must provide a way for its customers to keep their data private
until they decide to free their content. [The company] must only provide
incentive, not force, a user to share data.

## Transparency & Ethic-first

[The company] must value transparency in communicating its mission, goals and
choices. The more transparent [the company] is, the better.

[The company]'s primary motivation must be contributing to the common goods.
Hence, [the company] must always adopt the most ethical acts/behaviors/decisions
when multiple options are available to it.

## Investors must embrace this Manifesto

If [the Company] is raising funds, incoming investors must accept all rules
stated in this Manifesto without any modification. To prevent further corruption
of [the Company] values, [the Company] statuses deposited to the administration of
the country of affiliation should refer to this Manifesto.
